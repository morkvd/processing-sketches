### collatz.pde

started with code from [this great tutorial from The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYLWxwo1Ed8) but then added more randomness and color to the mix.

### GameOfLifeExplorer.pde 

started out with the built in game of life example that is in the example folder when you install processing, and changed it randomly select [the rule that governs if cells live or die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton). I also built-in various initial semi-random states that you can use as a starting point to get results that are visually interesting.
